                <h3>Accessing Part Manuals Online</h3>
                <p>Most PC part manufacturers provide digital manuals on their official websites. To find a manual, search for your part's exact model number (found on the box or the part itself) along with the word "manual" or "user guide" in your preferred search engine. For example, search "ASUS B550-F manual" or "Corsair RM750x user guide." You can also visit the manufacturer's support or downloads page and enter your model number. Manuals are usually available as accessible PDF files, which can be read with screen readers and are compatible with most devices.</p>
            <h2>Tools Needed & Safety Tips</h2>

                <h3>What is ESD (Electrostatic Discharge)?</h3>
                <p><strong>ESD</strong> is the sudden flow of electricity between two electrically charged objects, often caused by contact or a short. Even a small static shock can damage sensitive PC components like CPUs, RAM, and motherboards. To prevent ESD:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wear an anti-static wrist strap and clip it to an unpainted metal part of your case.</li>
                    <li>Touch a grounded metal object before handling components.</li>
                    <li>Avoid working on carpet and keep components in anti-static bags until use.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Following ESD precautions helps ensure your PC build is safe and reliable.</p>

            <h2>Essential PC Components</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> The main circuit board connecting all components. It determines what CPUs, RAM, and expansion cards you can use. Look for features like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and the number of USB ports.</li>
                    <li><strong>CPU (Processor):</strong> Executes instructions and calculations. Choose a CPU based on your needs (gaming, productivity, etc.). Modern CPUs have multiple cores and threads for multitasking.</li>
                    <li><strong>RAM (Memory):</strong> Temporary, high-speed storage for active programs and data. 16GB is recommended for most users; more for heavy multitasking or content creation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage (HDD, SSD, M.2):</strong> Permanent storage for your operating system, programs, and files. SSDs and M.2 drives are much faster than HDDs. Consider a combination for speed and capacity.</li>
                    <li><strong>GPU (Graphics Card):</strong> Handles rendering of images, video, and 3D graphics. Dedicated GPUs are essential for gaming, video editing, and creative work. Integrated graphics are fine for basic tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Power Supply (PSU):</strong> Converts AC power from the wall to DC power for your components. Choose a reliable, efficient PSU with enough wattage for your build. Modular PSUs help with cable management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Case:</strong> The enclosure that houses and protects all components. Choose a case that fits your motherboard size (ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX) and has good airflow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooling:</strong> Includes fans, heatsinks, and liquid cooling systems to keep components at safe temperatures. Good cooling extends component life and improves performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows, Linux, or macOS (for Apple hardware). Choose based on your software needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peripherals:</strong> Monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers, and webcam. Choose based on your usage and accessibility needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Optical Drive (for CDs/DVDs), Network Card (if not built-in), Sound Card (for advanced audio), RGB lighting, and fan controllers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always check compatibility between your CPU, motherboard, and RAM before purchasing. Use online PC part picker tools to avoid issues.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HDD (Hard Disk Drive):</strong> Uses spinning disks, slower, more affordable, higher capacities. Good for mass storage and backups.</li>
                    <li><strong>SATA SSD (Solid State Drive):</strong> Faster than HDD, no moving parts, uses SATA interface. Great for operating systems and frequently used programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>M.2 SSD:</strong> Small form factor, connects directly to motherboard, can use SATA or NVMe (PCIe) interface. NVMe M.2 SSDs are much faster than SATA SSDs. Ideal for ultra-fast boot and load times.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> For best performance, use an NVMe M.2 SSD for your operating system and a larger HDD for storage. Always back up important data to an external drive or cloud service.</p>
